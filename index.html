                    <td>SZA's first official album, 'Z,' released in 2014, is the most recent addition to my discography. My favourite tracks from this album include 'Sweet November' and 'Omega.' The artwork for SZA’s album Z is my favourite out of all of the albums. The colours are really pretty and the style is extremely aesthetically pleasing to me. I am a big fan of the 1800s Regency period, and this album cover is a modern twist to that aesthetic. I love most, to all, content SZA creates. She could release a song that is 10 minutes of silence, and I would add its own page to this website dedicated to it.</td>

                    <td>SZA's album “Ctrl” was the album that introduced me to her music. My all-time favourite SZA song is on this album and was the song that started my whole SZA admiration. The song is called “Supermodel”. I absolutely love the sound of this album. Each song is a stand-alone banger, and the cover is so inspiring on a creative level. Although I know all the words to this whole album and love ALL the songs on this album, my top songs right now in rank order are “Supermodel”, “Prom”, “20 Something”, “Go Gina”, and “Drew Barrymore”.</td>

                  	<td>In 2022 SZA realsed the Deluxe version of “Ctrl”. Which was a grace from God for me because most of the songs on the album that were "unrealsed" were some of my SZA faves at that time. So this album being released allowed me to properly stream the songs on Spotify instead of YouTube. In addition to 2017 Ctrl, I also know every song on this album but my top ones are “Love galore (Alt Version)”, “2AM”, “Awkward”, and “Doves in the Wind” (Originally from Ctrl but I got into that song because of the Deluxe version so i am putting it in this category).</td>

                    <td>23</td>
                  	<td>SZA's latest Album “SOS” is proof enough that SZA is still at the top of her game. This album has pushed SZA further into the well deserved spotlight. Some insider information about the album is the cover is actually inspired by a photo of Princess Diana on a boat, and also "SOS" happens to be SZA's longest album. The track “Special” reminds me of a sibling song to “Normal Girl”. I also really like an unreleased alternate version of "Open Arms" which features an extra verse, which takes me back to YouTube when I wanna listen. My top songs in order of rank are "Ghost in the Machine (feat. Phoebe Bridgers)", "F2F", "Good Days", "Special", and "Blind".</td>
